# Adaptive presentation
Some techniques can change the presentation of a page leaving the the full content and navigation intact, but trying that the user focus on some specific part of the page ignoring the others.

## [Stretchtext](../content_adaptation/index.md#stretchtext)
## [Zoom/Scale](../content_adaptation/index.md#zoomscale-fragments)

### [Fragment summarization](../content_adaptation/index.md#fragment-summarization)
## Layout
Layout adaptation is the only pure adaptive presentation technique, the other ones can be considered content or navigation adaptation techniques that affect to the presentation as well. The layout can be changed to fit within another application or a restricted display/bandwidth environment
### Partitioning/zooming
One technique that can be used to adapt the layout is to partition the presentation in subpages that can be viewed once at a time or to scale down the whole page and letting the user zoom into parts of it.
### Rearrangement
Another technique is the rearrangement of the content in order to make it fit to another layout more convenient to the user environment or characteristics. This rearrangement is different than the [sorting fragments](../content_adaptation/index.md#sorting-fragments) because where the latter has to do with the content of the fragments, the first is related to the presentation of that content.
