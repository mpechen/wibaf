# Adaptation Techniques
According to [Knutov09](dx.doi.org/10.1080/13614560902801608), adaptive techniques refer to methods of providing adaptation. Those techniques can be classified in the following taxonomy:
* [Content adaptation techniques](content_adaptation/index.md)
    * Inserting/Removing fragments
	* Altering fragments
	* Dimming fragments
	* Sorting fragments
	* Stretchtext
	* Zoom/Scale
	    * Conventional scaling/zooming
		* Fisheye view
		* Fragment summarization
* Adaptive presentation techniques(adaptive_presentation/index.md)
	* Dimming fragments
	* Sorting fragments
	* Stretchtext
	* Zoom/Scale
	    * Conventional scaling/zooming
		* Fisheye view
		* Fragment summarization
	* Layout
	    * Partitioning/zooming
		* Rearrangement
		* Fitting in a template
	* Link sorting/ordering
	* Link annotation
	* Combinatorial techniques
	    * Contextual links
		* Non-contextual links
		* Context, index links
		* Local and global maps
* Adaptive navigation techniques(adaptive_navigation/index.md)
	* Zoom/Scale
	    * Conventional scaling/zooming
		* Fisheye view
		* Fragment summarization
	* Link sorting/ordering
	* Link annotation
	* Combinatorial techniques
	    * Contextual links
		* Non-contextual links
		* Context, index links
		* Local and global maps
	* Link generation
	    * Anchor adaptation
		* URL adaptation
		* Destination adaptation
	* Guidance
	    * Direct (local) guidance
		* Global guidance
	* Link hiding
	    * Hiding
		* Disabling
		* Removal
		
As it can be noticed, there is some overlap between the three major techniques because sometimes content or navigation adaptation can be achieved adapting the presentation.
